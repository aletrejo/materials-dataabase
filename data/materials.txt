1	Knitted Mesh Crimped	7	"A range of knitted metal mesh produced on rotating machines with different metals that has been ‘crimped’ to create a textural and decorative effect. Knitting wire mesh is based on principles similar to garment knitting, except it is produced using specialized heavy-duty machinery. Initially formed as a cylinder, the knitted material is rolled to produce a ‘lay flat’ sock. The crimping is offered in a diamond, chevron or herringbone pattern. The meshes are produced using a circular knitting machine creating a flattened tube of any material available as a filament such as metal wires (steel; Stainless steel – grades 304L, 316L, 321, 310 and 310S, copper, aluminum, nickel and nickel/copper alloys), as well as plastics, glass fiber and carbon fiber. This forms a continuous strip of double layer mesh up to 1000 mm (39.4 in) wide. This mesh can then be onward-processed into a wide range of specialized engineered products. The wire gauge ranges from 0.05 – 0.6 mm (0.002 – 0.03 in) and the mesh sizes from fine (3.5 stitches per cm) to super-coarse (0.5 stitches per cm). The meshes may be cut with wire cutters and bent and shaped to requirements. Applications are for automotive, gardening, interior design, filtration and EMC shielding."	Library 1st Floor
2	Folded Concrete	6	"Concrete tiles that have been processed in a way to resemble folded and pleated fabric. By shaping and texturing a surface, it suggests the idea of a structured yet movable and soft environment. Pre-casting is used to create the cloth-like appearance, and designs can be fully customized. Iron based pigments are also used to create custom colors. The standard tile size is 20 in x 20 in (50 cm x 50 cm) and 0.39 in (1 cm) thick. Applications include external building facades and interior spaces."	Library 2nd Floor
